## Project Description

Park locator 2.0 is a complete rewrite and rebuild of my previous Park Locator full-stack application which acts as a skatepark locator & reviewer. The original project was built using Python with Flask, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax, SQLite and the Google Places & Maps APIs for Python. Version 2.0 will scrap this entirely in favour of:

## Tech Stack

JavaScript, React with Material-UI, Google Maps API for JavaScript, Node/Express.js, Firebase Authentication, PostgreSQL, Node.js to script and automate populating my postgres DB using the Google Places API for Node.js.

## Project goals & changes from Park locator 1.0

- Rebuild project with React, Node/Express & PostgreSQL.
- Improve UI and user experience with React.
- Scale up the number of skateparks from 20 in Vancouver to 3,500+ skateparks in North America.
- Add photos to reviews from the Google places API and also allow users to add their own reviews.
