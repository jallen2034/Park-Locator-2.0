## Project Description

Park locator 2.0 is a complete rewrite and rebuild of my previous Park Locator full-stack application which acts as a skatepark locator & reviewer. The original project was built using Python with Flask, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax, SQLite and the Google Places & Maps APIs for Python. Version 2.0 will scrap this entirely in favour of:

## Tech Stack 
JavaScript, React with Material-UI, Google Maps API for JavaScript, Node/Express.js, Firebase Authentication, PostgreSQL, Python to script and automate populating my postgres DB using the Google Places API for Python.

## Project goals & changes from Park locator 1.0
- Rebuild project with React, Node/Express & PostgreSQL.
